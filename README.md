This is a regression suite for Automated browser acceptance tests
Built on Specflow and Selenium using C# for plumbing 
NOTE: In order to allow the projects find the browser drivers, the solution should be saved on the C drive in a folder named "code"
alternatively, make changes to the App.config file changing the paths of the browser drivers to the appropriate location.
